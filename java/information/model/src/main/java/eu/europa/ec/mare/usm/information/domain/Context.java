/**
 * Holds a Context.<br/>
 * A context is an association of three elements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A scope (optional) based on a set of datasets from any 
 * applications. The goal  is to limit the visibility on data;</li>
 * <li>A role (mandatory) based on a set a features from any applications. 
 * The goal is  to define the actions that can be performed on data;</li>
 * <li>A set of contextual preferences (optional): These preferences are not 
 * managed through the USM user interface. B;</li>
 * </ul>
 * A context is defined by an USM administrator by associating it with a user. 
 * It is his responsibility to guarantee that the different elements composing 
 * the context are coherent from a business point of view;<br/>
 * A user may have no context if no role has been associated to him. 
 * He may have multiple contexts.;<br/>
 * The USM administrator cannot define the default context of the user. 
 * If an application wants to provide such a feature it may do so using a 
 * preference;<br/>
